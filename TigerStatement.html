    <h2>Statement Regarding the Events From Earlier Today - 02/03/16</h2>
    <p id="p1">All right, now that I've finished my homework due at midnight, let's address the <s>elephant</s> Pusheen in the room. As you all probably saw already, there was a little argument earlier over some translations of certain words. I just want it to be clear that we don't rely on Google Translate, except for getting a specific accent mark (which I do trust it for that purpose), and we do try our best to make sure we have the correct translations. Sometimes, we might get it wrong due to one of many reasons. I don't think it's very common that we do, but there may have been a few times. Vietnamese is complicated and I'll be honest, none of us are experts in the language. We all have varying degrees of fluency and if we encounter a word that we have some doubt about, we will go ask other people close to us who are more knowledgeable. However, as much as we may think we or our sources know, I don't think anyone can claim fully fluency in the language. The same goes for English. I will never in my life say that I am 100% fluent in English. I may be very knowledgeable and well-versed, but to say that I know everything about it is far from the truth. The same goes for all of you, for any language.</p>
    <p>Now to move on to the real issue here, I will NOT doubt anyone's knowledge of the Vietnamese language or culture. As long as they are more knowledgeable than me in that department, I will never say they are wrong. I WILL however, take sides on certain debates. It doesn't neccessarily mean that I think the other side is wrong, it's just that I believe one side over the other. I know that might sound weird and how is that not the same as saying someone is wrong. The thing is, I can't say that one side is wrong. I'm not qualified enough to make a statement like that due to my lack of knowledge of the Vietnamese language. I can only believe one more than the other. That being said, with regards to the disagreement about past Word of the Week words, I choose to take the side of what was shown in the newsletter. This decision is based not on my Vietnamese knowledge, but on my trust in Thao, our secretary for the 2014-2015 year, as well as trust in last year's E-board. As for the current academic year, the only word that was questionable, as far as I know, was "mục tiêu". When this issue was brought up, I went and took steps in finding out the correct meaning of the word. This involved asking other people much more fluent in Vietnamese, and yes, Reddit too. From these native Vietnamese sources, they all agreed that "mục tiêu" was more accurate <strong>in the context presented in the newsletter</strong>. Yes, "mục đích" is acceptable too, but "mục tiêu" is more accurate in the specific way we used it. So no one is really wrong in this sense.</p>
    <p>I never thought the newsletter challenges would cause these many issues, nor did I intend for them to be anything other than fun activities to work together on with your team. Am I going to stop making them? Of course not. Making them are just as fun for me as I hope they are for all of you. But it really does make me upset when I see trouble arise from one one of them. At the same time, I kind of am weirdly glad that people are passionate enough about VSA to argue over them. I definitely wish the passion would show in another form, but I guess it's good to see that people care. Tommy, I do appreciate your passion for the newsletter Word of the Weeks and for really being active in the Tiger group. But please try to channel that passion elsewhere instead of all at the Word of the Week translations! Once they're out, they stay that way. So there's no point in arguing because nothing will change and nothing good will come out of it, regardless of who may be right. I would please like for everyone to just move on! Everything that happened is now in the past and not relevant anymore. Let's just finish this newsletter challenge, get as many points from Map Diem challenges, and win once again! Camilla, thank you for working really hard on writing a story! And thanks Malia for helping with damage control earlier. To the rest of you, let's show that Tiger are the best Map Diem team!!</p>
    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Tigers Outing anyone?</p>
