    <!--
    ATTENTION: To all of you who like to peek at the source code, you guys get a heads-up about the newsletter hidden challenges for Map Diem.
    Starting this week, there will be a link somewhere in the newsletter that will direct you to a page with a set of challenges. What kind of challenges,
    I can't say. You'll have to find out for yourselves. Work with your team to solve these challenges to win points for your team! However, if you think
    you can find hints in the source code, then you're SOL lol. It's gonna be made so that you won't be able to see the revealing stuff (or at least
    I'm gonna try my best to make it so haha).
